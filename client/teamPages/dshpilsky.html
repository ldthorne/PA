                    <h3>Daniel Shpilsky</h3>
                    <p>Having worked in a variety of government offices, Daniel has had first-hand experience in getting involved with pressing issues facing his community. He hopes that the UnshelteredVoices campaign will bring to light the plight of those that have faced unimaginable adversity on the streets of Boston, and that this campaign will translate to tangible changes in government policy. In his spare time, Daniel enjoys playing soccer, travelling, playing in the snow and spending time with his three younger siblings.</p>
